# What is Viper

Taken directly from Viper's [documentation](https://github.com/spf13/viper#what-is-viper):

> Viper is a complete configuration solution for Go applications including 12-Factor apps. It is designed to work within an application, and can handle all types of configuration needs and formats.

Or put simply, **Viper is a library that parses and managings configuration
languages so you don't have to!** Spend less time writing code to manage your
configuration and instead focus on your business logic!
