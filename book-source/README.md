# Introduction

This is a quick reference guide on what the [spf13/viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) package is, and how it can be used to help speed up your development.

As a prerequisite, you'll need to be able to read Golang.

As with previous primers, this does not replace documentation and is aimed at
being just a cheatsheet or quickstart resource!

A note that the developer [spf13](https://github.com/spf13) is leaving their role as [Product Lead for Go at google](https://spf13.com/p/spf13-google/). Thanks for everything, Steve!
