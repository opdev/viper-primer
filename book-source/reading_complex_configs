# Reading Complex Configuration

So we've already got a simple way to read in a file from disk and map it to a
struct in Go, allowing us to make decisions based on the user's configuration.

What if we want the user to be able to pass us JSON instead of YAML? Well that's
not too bad. We just add a few more struct tags like this:

```go
type Configuration struct {
	LogLevel             string `yaml:"logLevel" json:"loglevel"`
	MagicFeatureEnabled  bool   `yaml:"magicFeatureEnabled" json:"magicFeatureEnabled"`
	SomethingNeatEnabled bool   `yaml:"somethingNeatEnabled" json:"somethingNeatEnabled"`
}
```

And then we can just the [encoding/json](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json)
library which also has an `Unmarshal` function. Reading a file from disk has
already been done, so we'd just need to read the file at both a `config.json` or
`config.yaml` path and then repeat the process as we did with the YAML
configuration. Easy peasy.

---

These days, environment variables are all the rage. They're easy to change in
continuous integration, test environments, etc. So let's add an environment
variable for each of these... something like:

```go
const (
	EnvLogLevel             = "NEATO_LOG_LEVEL"
	EnvMagicFeatureEnabled  = "NEATO_MAGIC_FEATURE_ENABLED"
	EnvSomethingNeatEnabled = "NEATO_SOMETHING_NEAT_ENABLED"
)
```

So these are our environment variable keys, and so we need to look for each of
them. In our example `neato` application, we'll enforce that environment
variables override the configuration file. Establishing and documenting
precedence is important, so that users know exactly how and why a value is being
overridden! 

So now our `main.go` has to handle the precedence, so we'll read the
configuration first, and then we'll read the environment.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strings"

	"gopkg.in/yaml.v3"
)

const (
	EnvLogLevel             = "NEATO_LOG_LEVEL"
	EnvMagicFeatureEnabled  = "NEATO_MAGIC_FEATURE_ENABLED"
	EnvSomethingNeatEnabled = "NEATO_SOMETHING_NEAT_ENABLED"
)

func main() {
	// read the configuration file from disk and store it in our struct.
	d, _ := os.ReadFile("config.yaml")
	var cfg Configuration
	yaml.Unmarshal(d, &cfg)

	// override the configuration with environment variables
	if key := os.Getenv(EnvLogLevel); key != "" {
		cfg.LogLevel = key
	}

	if key := os.Getenv(EnvMagicFeatureEnabled); key != "" {
		envValue := false
		if strings.ToLower(key) == "true" {
			envValue = true
		}

		cfg.MagicFeatureEnabled = envValue
	}

	if key := os.Getenv(EnvSomethingNeatEnabled); key != "" {
		envValue := false
		if strings.ToLower(key) == "true" {
			envValue = true
		}

		cfg.SomethingNeatEnabled = envValue
	}

	// run our business logic
	fmt.Println("The Log Level is: ", cfg.LogLevel)
	fmt.Println("We are using the Magic Feature: ", cfg.MagicFeatureEnabled)
	fmt.Println("We are using Something Neat ", cfg.SomethingNeatEnabled)
}

type Configuration struct {
	LogLevel             string `yaml:"logLevel" json:"loglevel"`
	MagicFeatureEnabled  bool   `yaml:"magicFeatureEnabled" json:"magicFeatureEnabled"`
	SomethingNeatEnabled bool   `yaml:"somethingNeatEnabled" json:"somethingNeatEnabled"`
}
```

Without modifying the environment, our output looks like this (values from our
configuration file):

```
$ go run .
The Log Level is:  debug
We are using the Magic Feature:  true
We are using Something Neat  false
```

But if we modify our environment, we see that our environment's values win out
over the configuration file.
```
$ NEATO_LOG_LEVEL=info go run .
The Log Level is:  info
We are using the Magic Feature:  true
We are using Something Neat  false
```

---

So far, things have been pretty simple! But more than half of our main.go file
is focused on handling our configuration... and we haven't even scratched the
surface!

What if we wanted to have more complex configurations, with maps or arrays?

```yaml
logging:
	level: debug
	file: /var/log/neato.log
magicFeature:
	enabled: true
	backends:
	- awesome.example.com:8080
	- epic.example.com:8080
somethingNeat: 
	enabled: true
	endpoint: https://neat.example.com/v1/	
```

Building out a struct in Go is simple enough, but now each of these keys needs a
corresponding environment variable. And for each environment variable, we'll need to
build out logic that replaces the values read in from our config file with the values 
read in from the environment.

What about default values? If the user didn't provide a value, but we need it to
run our logic, it stands to reason that a sane default should be used. We'll
need to codify that default either by building out a `DefaultConfig` out of our
`Configuration` struct, reading a default from disk, or really any other way
that you can architect your solution.

None of these problems are too complex to solve on your own, but the Viper
library aims to help speed up your development by giving you simple hooks that
solve this problem without having to write your own code to do so.
